# BSmag
The BSmag Toolbox is a Matlab toolbox for the numerical integration of the Biot-Savart law. It provides a simple solution to calculate the magnetic flux density generated by an arbitrary current carrying filament in the magnetostatic approximation.

If you use this code, send me message with the reference and I will add it to the users list. If you would like to acknowledge it (and direct others to it), you could use a reference like this:
